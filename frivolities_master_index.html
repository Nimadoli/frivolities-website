  <p>Makeup artist Mikayla says that by using her method, she's been able to <q>trick people</q> into thinking she <q>has no acne at all</q>.
  </p>

  <p>In her own words:</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/beauty-hair/makeup/a31974802/viral-tiktok-acne-concealing-makeup-hack/">
  Apply the serum, apply the primer. Take your concealer brush with the concealer and cover up all your acne. Now this is the most important part, once you have the concealer on don't touch it, don't blend it, leave it alone for two minutes and then apply your foundation.
  </blockquote>

In my wild erratic fancy visions come to me of Clancy

Gone a-droving “down the Cooper” where the western drovers go;

As the stock are slowly stringing, Clancy rides behind them singing,

For the drover’s life has pleasures that the townsfolk never know.

    <h2 id="culture">Culture plays a role in our concepts of beauty</h2>
    <p class="beautyconcept">
      The global averages hide significant cultural and social differences. In countries like Russia and China, overall physical attributes are seen as far more important than non-physical ones when it comes to beauty. In Russia, sexiness is strongly associated with beauty. In Saudi Arabia, not at all. You can easily stroll through the data, triggering a range of cultural stereotypes as you go. Of course, beauty is culturally constructed. It's in the eye of the beholder.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <h4>Overcoming perfectionism</h4>
      <p>
        You're not alone. Perfectionism is rife among Australian women — that deep belief you constantly need to give more, do more, be more. Here's how to overcome it.
      </p>
      <a title="Overcoming perfectionism article" href="https://www.abc.net.au/everyday/advice-for-overcoming-perfectionism/10196258">Read more</a>
    </aside>
    <p class="beautyconcept">
      It was a missed opportunity not to ask these global citizens about beauty in men. I assume if they did, the results would not have found — as they did in this survey about women — that professional success and financial success are the least beautiful attributes. I wonder how comforting this kind of research really is for young women who can't remember a world before social media. This research might show that, on the whole, we champion a deeper understanding of beauty — but in our daily lives, how much do we actually feel this is true? Or, more to the point, how much do we feel other people believe this to be true?
    </p>
    <h4>'Sometimes you feel like it's so hard to disengage'</h4>
    <p class="beautyconcept">
      Last year I conducted a research project with young women in their mid-teens and early 20s about body image and social media. The project explored how consumption of social media impacted on their views about beauty, their bodies and plastic surgery.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <h4>Using Instagram to boost (not destroy) your self-esteem</h4>
      <p>
        There's a lot of fakery and bad advice on social media, but if you follow a different type of user, your feed can be full of people, photos and ideas that build you up.
      </p>
      <a title="Using Instagram article" href="https://www.abc.net.au/everyday/how-to-make-instagram-body-positive-diverse-empowering-platform/10630034">Read more</a>
    </aside>
    <p class="beautyconcept">
      In that research we found that young women welcomed the focus on more diverse and "healthier" attitudes to women's bodies in the media and society at large. That being said, they thought such attempts were mostly swamped by the intense and relentless pressure to look a certain way, exacerbated by social media. One 20&#8209;year&#8209;old in the research explained it this way: <q>My close friends will send me and share images from Instagram just saying, 'Oh my God, this person, look at this'. It's just constant and normal now and daily.</q> The young women knew the perfect images on social media are carefully chosen, edited, filtered and adapted to produce the best possible results, that it is a skewed version of reality. However, this understanding doesn't lessen the impact those images have on their perception of their own bodies.
    </p>
    <details><summary>...continue reading</summary>
      <p class="beautyconcept">
        <q>Sometimes you feel like it's so hard to disengage. You might see people on the street and compare yourself to them but it doesn't stop when you get home because you go through social media and you have all these pictures of beautiful people. So it's this constant pressure, not necessarily just outside but even when you're inside on your own with all of these images all of the time. It's this constant reminder that this is how you should look and this is what's acceptable in society.</q> Of course, there are plenty of inspirational images about inner beauty on Instagram. Sometimes they feature a perfectly formed young woman walking along a beach.
